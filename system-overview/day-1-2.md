# Operational Preparedness: Day One / Two

### Overview

This article offers Operational Preparedness (a.k.a. Readiness) ***Day One and Day Two task list*** templates for CockroachDB cluster deployments. Operators may leverage these task lists as a starting point for building custom deployment plans driven by the organization's data services SLAs.

Operational preparedness is the *operator's ability to deploy, maintain, and operate CockroachDB environments*. A measure of customer's operational readiness may be the number of P1/P2 CockroachDB Technical Support issues open monthly. 



### "Day N" Nomenclature

Operational preparedness can be prioritized into two lists of required tasks, commonly referred to as "Day 1 and "Day 2" preparedness (readiness).

Completing the tasks to meet requirements of "Day 1" and "Day 2" phases is a prerogative of IT organizations.

**"Day 1"** is the scope of minimally required technical enablement and procedural preparedness before CockroachDB service is ready for a production deployment. "Day 1" is effectively *MVP of Operational Preparedness*, consisting of tasks that *must* be completed before the initial "go live" date.

**"Day 2"** is the scope of activity to achieve a meaningfully *complete Operational Preparedness*, with automation of all daily operations routines. This phase is a continuation from the Day 1 preparedness baseline.



> âœ… A term "Day 0" is often used in reference to the Application development phase by teams responsible for the Application Architecture and Engineering . That phase is outside the scope of this article - herein the Application tier development and testing is assumed "completed".



The practical purpose of defining Day 1 and Day 2 preparedness is to *safely* bring the initial deployment date forward. By focusing on Day 1 requirements up front, operations teams can prevent end-user / applications problems from occurring after the CockroachDB service goes live.

The Day 1 and Day 2 definitions are best presented as a categorized, but not necessarily a prioritized task list, since all task activities must be completed to claim a given level of preparedness.

The boundary between Day 1 and Day 2 tasks can be generalized, as in the proposed task list templates, however each deployment plan is unique, driven by specific customer requirements and SLA definitions. While developing the custom deployment plan from this template, operators may promote or de-prioritize a task by moving it between Day 1 and Day 2 lists, and add new or remove impertinent tasks to either list.
